# TwitterBot

This is just a basic twitter bot, grabs and posts posts from a site looking for quotes(iheartquotes.com).
It's set to do it every half hour.

Replace your own api keys into it. If you don't use your own api keys, it just won't work. Mine have changed as of making this video so everything is different on my end and these no longer work and it doesn't matter if they're on github.
Thanks for watching my video and have fun! :)

Here is the youtube video:
